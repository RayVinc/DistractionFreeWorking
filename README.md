# DistractionFreeWorking
Utilizing psychological tricks and methods to help work distraction free and focused.

1. Method (from Dr. Andrew Huberman):
Stare at one thing for 60 seconds.
Distracted eye movement is causing our thoughts to be distracted as well, so focusing the eyes on a single point for 60 seconds while breathing deeply will drasticly help to regain focus.

*The feature should display a single circle in the middle of the screen and run a timer outside of the focused vision for 60 seconds. Circle might increase and decrease in size to help stimulate deep breathing*

2. Method:
Confronting the distractions for a limited amount of time to allow the head to have some time off.
Giving yourself 10 - 15 min to follow your distractions, will create a stronger focus for the working time after. I've noticed is that if you put a 15-minute timer just in front of yourself, somewhere after 10 minutes, you start to constantly chech the timer, realizing that the time is crippling and ot almost feels like you don't want to do the distraction anymore. You suddenly realize that there is no longer satisfaction in this distraction and you just want this to end. I often found myself ending the timer much earlier than planned.

*The feature should have a timer for 10 or 15 minutes that is ticking down and plays a calm noise when the time has run out*

3. Method (Pomodoro Technique):
The Pomodoro Technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named "pomodoros," after the Italian word for 'tomato,' inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility. There are six steps in the original technique:

-Decide on the task to be done.
-Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
-Work on the task until the timer rings.
-After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
-If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go back to step 2.
-After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

Additionally, a small list can help note down any distractions that pop up in the head during the focus time. By writing them down, our brain is satisfied for the moment and is willing to let them go. After the focus time, the list helps remember anything that was put off for later to keep the head distraction free.

*The feature should have a customizable timer for the focus time and a small editable list to note down distracting thoughts to be checked afterwards*
